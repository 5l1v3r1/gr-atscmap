The goal of this project is to enable the use of the Nuand
FPGA based ATSC modulator and root-raised-cosine filter with
the standard osmosdr Sink block.

A stand alone Python script (atsc-blade-fpga.py) is provided
in the apps directory. Usage is:

./atsc-blade-fpga.py input_file [output_file]

The input file is an MPEG-2 Transport Stream at the ATSC
bit-rate of 19.392658 Mbps. A test stream can be downloaded
from:

http://www.w6rz.net/advatsc.ts

A gnuradio-companion flowgraph is included but requires the
ATSC block definitions from https://github.com/hpux735/grc_blocks
to be installed.

Build instructions:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
